# React TypeScript App

This repository contains a React application built using TypeScript. The app provides a solid foundation for creating scalable and maintainable web applications using the React library with the added benefits of static typing provided by TypeScript.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-typescript-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```
   cd react-typescript-app
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This command will start the development server and open the app in your default browser. The app will automatically reload if you make any changes to the source code.

5. **Build for production**:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

   This command will create an optimized build of the app in the `build` directory, ready for deployment.

6. **Run tests**:
   ```
   npm test
   ```

   This command will execute the test suites and provide feedback on the test results.

7. **Linting**:
   ```
   npm run lint
   ```

   This command will run the linter and display any linting errors or warnings in the console.

## Project Structure

The project structure follows a typical React application setup:

```
├── public
│   ├── index.html
│   └── ...
├── src
│   ├── components
│   ├── pages
│   ├── App.tsx
│   ├── index.tsx
│   └── ...
├── tests
│   ├── unit
│   └── integration
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── webpack.config.js
└── ...
```

- **`public`**: Contains static assets and the main `index.html` file used as the entry point for the application.
- **`src`**: Contains the source code of the application.
  - **`components`**: Houses reusable components used throughout the application.
  - **`pages`**: Contains individual pages or views of the application.
  - **`App.tsx`**: The root component that initializes the application.
  - **`index.tsx`**: The entry point of the application.
- **`tests`**: Contains test suites for unit tests and integration tests.
  - **`unit`**: Houses unit tests for individual components or modules.
  - **`integration`**: Contains integration tests that verify the behavior of multiple components working together.
- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by version control.
- **`package.json`**: Lists the project dependencies and provides scripts for running various commands.
- **`tsconfig.json`**: Configuration file for TypeScript compiler options.
- **`webpack.config.js`**: Configuration file for webpack bundler.
